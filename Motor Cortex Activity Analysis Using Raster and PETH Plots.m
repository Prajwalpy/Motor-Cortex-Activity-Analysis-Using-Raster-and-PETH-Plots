%% 1a. Response Fields:
% The field of the data in this assignment refers to be the motor response field, which means it's about measuring how neurons fire in response to specific finger movements, 
% like moving your index finger or combining thumb and index movements.

%1b. Individual Neuron Responses:
%Based on the raster plots and PSTHs we can get insights into the response fields of the three chosen neurons:
% Channel 40: This neuron shows the strongest response to moving the index and middle fingers together, with a peak firing rate of about 90 Hz, which is notably higher than other conditions.
% Channel 30: This neuron seems to respond most to moving the thumb, index, and middle fingers together, with a peak firing rate of about 50 Hz.
% Channel 54: This neuron appears to respond most to moving the index finger alone, with a peak firing rate of about 40 Hz.


%% 2a. Decoding Finger Movements:
%The selection of channels 40, 30, and 54 proves to be strategically advantageous for decoding finger movements due to their distinct response fields:
%    - Chan54 (Unit 1): This neuron helps identify when the index finger is moved individually, with a peak response of 35 Hz and lower activity for other movements. 
%    - Chan30 (Unit 1): This neuron effectively detects when the index finger is moved alone or in combination with the thumb, showing strong activity around 45 Hz. 
%    - Chan40 (Unit 1): This neuron reliably detects when the index and middle fingers are moved together, with a peak response of 90 Hz, which is significantly higher than for other actions.
    
% 2b. Action Potential Firing Rate Thresholds:
%    - Chan54:  30 Hz threshold is good for detecting index finger movement alone, as its peak is 35 Hz, above other movements (20-25 Hz).
%    - Chan30:  Threshold of about 35 Hz works to catch index-related movements, as its peaks for these are higher (40-45 Hz) than others (around 20-35 Hz).
%    - Chan40:  60 Hz threshold is ideal for spotting when you move index and middle fingers together, as its peak is 90 Hz, well above others (up to 45 Hz).
% Each neuronâ€™s threshold differs because their baselines and peak responses vary.

%% Individual Neuron Responses:
%The selection of channels 40, 30, and 54 proves to be strategically advantageous for decoding finger movements due to their distinct response fields:
% Chan54: This neuron seems to respond most strongly when moving the thumb or middle finger individually, suggesting its role is in controlling these specific single finger movements.
% Chan30: This neuron shows the strongest response when moving the thumb, index, and middle fingers together, indicating itâ€™s involved in coordinating multiple fingers at once.
% Chan40: This neuron responds most when the thumb and index fingers are moving together, pointing to its role in controlling this specific combination of fingers.

% Decoding Finger Movements: 
% Chan54: This neuron is particularly good at detecting individual thumb or middle finger movements, with strong firing rates of 20â€“30 Hz, making it useful for decoding these specific movements. 
% Chan30: This neuron shows its highest activity, around 30â€“35 Hz, when the thumb, index, and middle fingers are moved together, so itâ€™s well-suited for decoding this combined movement. 
% Chan40: This neuron also peaks at 35â€“40 Hz for that same combined movement, and it responds strongly to individual thumb movement (30â€“35 Hz), which could help decode both.


%  Action Potential Firing Rate Thresholds:
%  Chan54: A threshold of 20 Hz seems good for detecting individual thumb or middle finger movements, as its firing rate for these is above this level, while combined movements are usually lower.
%  Chan30: Setting the threshold at 30 Hz works well for detecting the combined thumb, index, and middle finger movement, as this is where it shows the strongest response.
%  Chan40: A 35 Hz threshold is suitable for detecting the same combined movement, though it might also catch some individual thumb movements, which can reach up to 35 Hz.
